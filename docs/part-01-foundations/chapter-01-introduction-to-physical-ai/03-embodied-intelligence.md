# Embodied Intelligence: Philosophy & Implementation

:::info Coming Soon
This lesson is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive content covering:

- **Perception-Action Loops**: How robots sense, reason, and act in continuous cycles
- **World Models**: Internal representations of environment state and dynamics
- **Symbol Grounding Problem**: Connecting abstract concepts to physical reality
- **Embodied Cognition**: Why having a body changes what intelligence means
- **Affordances**: How robots understand what actions are possible

**Expected Completion**: This lesson will be available soon.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Explain embodied intelligence** and how it differs from disembodied AI
2. **Describe perception-action loops** in robot systems
3. **Understand world models** and their role in robot reasoning
4. **Analyze the symbol grounding problem** in Physical AI
