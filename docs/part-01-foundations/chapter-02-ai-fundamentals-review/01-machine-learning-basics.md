# Machine Learning Basics

:::info Coming Soon
This lesson is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive content covering:

- **Learning Paradigms**: Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement learning
- **Training vs. Testing**: Generalization, overfitting, cross-validation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices
- **Robotics Applications**: Perception model training, behavior learning, anomaly detection
- **Practical Considerations**: Data collection for robots, domain shift, active learning

**Expected Completion**: This lesson will be available soon.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish between learning paradigms** and select appropriate approaches for robotics tasks
2. **Evaluate model performance** using appropriate metrics for robot perception and control
3. **Diagnose overfitting** and apply regularization techniques
4. **Understand data requirements** for training robot learning systems
