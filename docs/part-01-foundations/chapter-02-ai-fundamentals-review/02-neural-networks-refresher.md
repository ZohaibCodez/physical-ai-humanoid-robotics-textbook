# Neural Networks Refresher

:::info Coming Soon
This lesson is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive content covering:

- **Neural Network Basics**: Neurons, layers, activation functions, forward propagation
- **Training Process**: Backpropagation, gradient descent, loss functions, optimizers (SGD, Adam)
- **CNN Architectures**: Convolutional layers, pooling, ResNet, EfficientNet for robot vision
- **Sequential Models**: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs for temporal data, trajectory prediction
- **Transformers**: Attention mechanisms, ViT (Vision Transformers), applications in robotics

**Expected Completion**: This lesson will be available soon.
