# Computer Vision Fundamentals

:::info Coming Soon
This lesson is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive content covering:

- **Image Processing Basics**: Filtering, edge detection, feature extraction (SIFT, ORB)
- **Object Detection**: YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD, real-time detection for robotics
- **Semantic Segmentation**: FCN, U-Net, Mask R-CNN for scene understanding
- **Depth Estimation**: Stereo vision, monocular depth, structured light sensors
- **Perception Pipelines**: End-to-end vision systems for robot navigation and manipulation

**Expected Completion**: This lesson will be available soon.
