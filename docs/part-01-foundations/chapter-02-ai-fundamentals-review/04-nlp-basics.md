# Natural Language Processing Basics

:::info Coming Soon
This lesson is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive content covering:

- **Text Processing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging
- **Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT)
- **Intent Detection**: Classification models for understanding robot commands
- **LLM Integration**: Using GPT-4, Claude for natural robot interaction
- **Speech Recognition**: Whisper, end-to-end speech-to-text for voice commands

**Expected Completion**: This lesson will be available soon.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Process natural language input** for robot commands
2. **Implement intent detection** for conversational interfaces
3. **Integrate LLMs** into robot interaction systems
4. **Understand speech recognition** for voice-controlled robots
