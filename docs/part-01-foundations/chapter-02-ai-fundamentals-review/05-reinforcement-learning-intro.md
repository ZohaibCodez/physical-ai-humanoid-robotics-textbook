# Reinforcement Learning Introduction

:::info Coming Soon
This lesson is currently under development. Check back soon for comprehensive content covering:

- **MDP Fundamentals**: States, actions, rewards, policies, value functions
- **Q-Learning**: Temporal difference learning, Q-tables, exploration vs. exploitation
- **Policy Gradients**: REINFORCE, actor-critic methods, PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Reward Shaping**: Designing rewards for robot tasks, avoiding reward hacking
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Domain randomization, reality gap, training in simulation

**Expected Completion**: This lesson will be available soon.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Formulate robot tasks as MDPs** with states, actions, and rewards
2. **Implement Q-learning** for simple robot control tasks
3. **Understand policy gradient methods** (PPO, SAC) for continuous control
4. **Design reward functions** that encourage desired robot behaviors
5. **Apply sim-to-real techniques** to transfer learned policies to hardware
