# Part 1: Foundations of Physical AI

Welcome to Part 1 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook! This foundational section establishes the conceptual and technical groundwork for your journey into embodied artificial intelligence.

## The Digital-to-Physical Transition

For decades, AI has thrived in purely digital environments—mastering chess, translating languages, generating images, and powering recommendation systems. But a profound transformation is underway: **AI is breaking free from screens and entering the physical world.**

This isn't just about making robots smarter. It's about fundamentally rethinking what intelligence means when it must interact with:
- **Uncertain sensors** that provide noisy, incomplete data
- **Physical actuators** with latency, limited precision, and safety constraints
- **Real-time deadlines** where computation must complete before the robot crashes
- **Unpredictable environments** where the coffee mug moves, the floor is slippery, and humans walk into the workspace

Part 1 prepares you to understand and navigate these challenges.

## What You'll Learn in Part 1

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
You'll understand why Physical AI requires fundamentally different approaches than software-only systems. We'll explore the robotics revolution, define embodied intelligence, survey real-world applications, and map your 13-week learning path.

**Key Questions:**
- What makes physical AI fundamentally different from digital AI?
- Who are the major players driving the robotics revolution?
- How do robots perceive, reason about, and act in the real world?
- Where is Physical AI being deployed today?

### Chapter 2: AI Fundamentals Review
Whether you're coming from software engineering, traditional AI/ML, or starting fresh, this chapter ensures everyone has the necessary AI foundations. We'll review machine learning basics, neural networks, computer vision, NLP essentials, and reinforcement learning—all contextualized for robotics applications.

**Key Questions:**
- How do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning apply to robotics?
- What neural network architectures power modern robot perception?
- How do robots "see" and "understand" their environment?
- How can robots learn from experience?

## Learning Approach

Part 1 is **conceptual and strategic**, not hands-on code-heavy. You won't install ROS 2 or write robot controllers yet—that comes in Part 2. Instead, you'll build the mental models that make everything else make sense.

Think of Part 1 as the foundation of a building. Without it, subsequent learning becomes fragile and confusing. With it, advanced topics in motion planning, perception, and control will feel like natural extensions of core principles.

### Recommended Study Strategy

1. **Read actively, not passively** — Pause to think through thought experiments, sketch diagrams, and connect concepts to your existing knowledge
2. **Don't rush** — These foundational concepts compound throughout the course
3. **Engage with interactive elements** — Click on collapsible sections, work through exercises, explore further reading
4. **Take notes** — Summarize key concepts in your own words

## Prerequisites

- **Curiosity** about how AI systems interact with the physical world
- **Basic programming** familiarity (Python preferred, but any language works)
- **Mathematical comfort** with algebra, geometry, and basic calculus (we'll review as needed)
- **Open mindset** toward interdisciplinary thinking (AI + physics + engineering + philosophy)

*No prior robotics experience required!*

## Estimated Time

**⏱️ Total Time for Part 1**: 12-16 hours

- **Core reading**: 8-10 hours (10 lessons × 50-60 minutes each)
- **Interactive exercises**: 2-3 hours
- **Further reading and exploration**: 2-3 hours

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 1, you'll move to **Part 2: ROS 2 Ecosystem**, where theory transforms into practice. You'll install ROS 2 Humble, write your first robot nodes, and begin building the technical skills that power modern robotics systems.

But first, let's build the foundation.
