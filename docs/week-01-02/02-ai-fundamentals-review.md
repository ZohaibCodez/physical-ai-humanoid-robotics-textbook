# AI Fundamentals Review

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Review key AI/ML concepts relevant to Physical AI
- Understand neural network architectures used in robotics
- Apply reinforcement learning principles to robot control
- Recognize when to use supervised vs. unsupervised learning

## Introduction

Before diving deep into Physical AI systems, let's review the core AI/ML concepts that underpin intelligent robot behavior. This chapter serves as a refresher for those with AI background and a foundation-builder for transitioning to embodied intelligence.

## Supervised Learning in Robotics

**Applications**:
- Object detection and classification
- Pose estimation
- Grasping point prediction

:::tip Quick Review
Supervised learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to train models. In robotics, this might be images labeled with object bounding boxes or robot trajectories labeled with success/failure.

## Reinforcement Learning for Control

**Key Concepts**:
- Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward
- Policy: Mapping from states to actions
- Value Function: Expected cumulative reward

**Robotics Applications**:
- Learning locomotion gaits
- Manipulation policies
- Navigation strategies

## Computer Vision Essentials

**Core Techniques**:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Object Detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Semantic Segmentation
- Depth Estimation

## Summary

This chapter reviewed AI/ML fundamentals with robotics applications in mind. Understanding these concepts is crucial for the perception, planning, and control systems we'll build in subsequent chapters.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Supervised learning powers most perception systems
- Reinforcement learning excels at robot control
- Computer vision is essential for spatial understanding
- Integration of multiple AI techniques creates robust Physical AI
