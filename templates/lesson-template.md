# [LESSON TITLE]

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **[Primary objective]**: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- **[Second objective]**: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- **[Third objective]**: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- **[Optional fourth objective]**: [Specific, measurable outcome]

## Introduction

[Opening paragraph: Hook the reader with a compelling problem, question, or real-world scenario that this lesson addresses. Make it relevant and engaging.]

[Second paragraph: Provide context for why this topic matters in the broader field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Connect to previous lessons if applicable.]

[Optional third paragraph: Preview the structure of this lesson and what students will accomplish by the end.]

## [MAIN SECTION 1 TITLE]

[Introductory paragraph explaining the core concept and why it's important.]

### [Subsection 1.1 Title]

[Detailed explanation with clear, progressive logic. Use examples and analogies where helpful.]

:::tip Pro Tip
[Best practice, optimization, or insider knowledge that enhances understanding]
:::

[Continue explanation...]

### [Subsection 1.2 Title]

[Build on previous subsection. If introducing formulas, provide intuition first, then mathematical formulation.]

**Mathematical Formulation** (if applicable):

$$
\text{equation} = \text{explanation of terms}
$$

Where:
- $\text{term1}$: Definition
- $\text{term2}$: Definition

[Explain the equation in plain language and provide intuition for why it works.]

## [MAIN SECTION 2 TITLE]

[Continue building on concepts. Show progression from theory to implementation.]

### Code Example: [Descriptive Title]

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
[Module docstring explaining purpose and context]

Requirements:
- Python 3.10+
- [List required packages]
"""

from typing import List, Optional, Dict
import numpy as np

# Configuration
class Config:
    """Configuration parameters with clear defaults."""
    parameter_name: float = 1.0
    # More parameters...

def main_function(input_data: np.ndarray, config: Config) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    [Function docstring explaining purpose, algorithm, and usage]
    
    Args:
        input_data: [Description with expected shape/type]
        config: [Configuration object description]
    
    Returns:
        [Description of return value with shape/type]
    
    Example:
        >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        >>> result = main_function(data, Config())
        >>> print(result)
        [expected output]
    """
    # Implementation with clear comments
    result = input_data * config.parameter_name
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Usage example
    sample_data = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    output = main_function(sample_data, Config())
    print(f"Result: {output}")
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Result: [1. 2. 3.]
```

[Explanation of the code: Walk through key parts, explain design choices, and highlight important concepts.]
